Long Term Goals:

    - Make use of PEAR classes
    - Split DotWeb into two parts with basic and full
      functionality
    - Write a specification for DotWeb Basic and implement it
      as extension for PHP 5
    - Port this extension to other scripting languages like Perl,
      Python, Ruby etc.
    - No PHP 5 code. DotWeb shall be a PHP 4 library which is
      fully compatible with PHP 5

For 0.02:

    - FieldValidators for regexps, email and custom code
    - register event for variable defined
    - sort method for select
    - <dotweb:text/>
    - <dotweb:list/>
    - strong checks for missing attributes in templates
    - better error messages

After 0.02:

    - get methods for all private data
    - add support for JavaScript event handlers to all controls
    - parse options of select
    - tabindex for all form controls
    - additional client side form validation with JavaScript
    - intensive testing by using it to build real applications
    - improve API documentation
    - more examples
    - parse text for RadioButtons and Checkboxes
