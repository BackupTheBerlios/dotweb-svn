----------------

Since DotWeb uses PHPs expat XML parser you are forced to use valid XHTML for all your templates. This means that you have to close every tag in your template even tags like <br/> or <link/>.

Otherwise you will get an error message from the XML parser and in the case that you include some other files in your template the file number mentioned in the error message will be incorrect. DotWeb will get nicer and more useful error messages in one of the next version. So stay tuned. There are some reason why this is just an alpha release ;)
