ROOT INSTALLATION

Installing DotWeb is very easy. First of all you must move this directory to a position in your file system where you think it fits best. Take /usr/share for example. Now you just have to edit your php.ini and add the directory where you have installed DotWeb to your include_path. Your new include_path could look like this:

include_path = ".:/usr/share/pear:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/dotweb"

After restarting your webserver you should be able to access DotWebs WebPage class in your PHP code with

require_once("class.webpage.php");


NON ROOT INSTALLATION

If you don't have an root account for the server your webpage is hosted on there is still a way to install DotWeb.

Copy the DotWeb directory somewhere where you have write access and then add the following lines of code at the beginning of your scripts:

$incpath = ini_get("include_path");
ini_set("include_path", "$incpath:/your/path/to/dotweb");
